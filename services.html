            <div class="accordian-content">
              <p>Our process begins with a meeting to discuss your project.</p>
              <p>We will meet you onsite, look at the proposed work site, and take initial measurements. During this
                initial phase, we will learn about your priorities and preferences, including why you are remodeling as
                well as your wants, needs, and desires. Your existing home may have some unique opportunities or
                challenges, which we would like to learn about as well. Along the way, we listen very carefully to what
                you are telling us.</p>
              <p>At this time, we will discuss an approximate amount you want to invest in the project and help to set a
                tentative budget for the entire project. We will discuss and address any questions you may have about
                your project, the process, and our company. If you would like to proceed to the next step, we agree to a
                set budget to develop design ideas and agree on an initial deposit amount.</p>

            <summary>Step 2: Develop Initial Ideas, Plans, and Estimates</summary>
            <div class="accordian-content">
              <p>The next step is to begin working on a design.</p>
              <p>After your deposit is finalized, our designers take the time needed to understand how you plan to use
                your space. For example, if you are undertaking a kitchen renovation, our designers need to understand
                how you plan to use your kitchen, who will be in the kitchen, how many cooks are working together,
                whether they are left-handed or right-handed, and so on. In fact, we have a packet of information and a
                questionnaire that you can fill out as your “homework,” ensuring that we design a dream kitchen that
                truly fits your needs.</p>
              <p>As part of the design phase, we create estimates of what the ideas and options will likely cost. These
                initial cost estimates will use placeholders called “allowances” for products, materials, and finishes
                you will eventually need to select, which can impact the cost of the project, sometimes significantly.
              </p>
              <p>However, unlike some remodelers who use low-ball the allowances, we will use more realistic allowances
                based on the information you provided in our first meeting. So, if you want a luxury kitchen, the
                allowances used will be higher than if you are looking for a basic kitchen. This will help you make more
                informed decisions, based on more realistic cost information, about how to proceed with the subsequent
                design work and construction. Please click on A Note About Our Process to learn more.</p>

            <div class="accordian-content">
              <p>We meet again.</p>
              <p>
                We meet again to go over the initial ideas, plans, and estimates. We will discuss the options and you
                can decide which ideas and plan options you would like to move forward with refining further.</p>

            <div class="accordian-content">
              <p>We now develop and refine the ideas and plans you selected in Step 3.</p>
              <p>
                At this point, we refine the cost estimates and create a list of product and finish selections. We meet
                again and present everything to you for your review and discussion. If you have any questions, we
                address them. Once you have all the information you need, you'll decide whether to proceed or not. Upon
                your approval to proceed, we prepare a construction agreement.</p>

              <p>We begin the construction phase of the project.</p>
              <p>
                We start by finalizing and submitting plans for permits. Next, we schedule the project and have
                pre-construction meetings with our team. You complete making any product and finish selections not
                already made.
              </p>
              <p>
                We meet with you and go over the details of how the construction phase will flow and you get to meet
                with some of the team that will be working on your project. We address any questions or concerns you may
                have before beginning construction.

            <summary>Step 6: Post-Project Survey</summary>
            <div class="accordian-content">
              <p>Your feedback is vital.</p>
              <p>
                While we are constantly communicating with you during the project, at the end of every project we ask
                you to complete an online survey performed by GuildQuality (GQ), an independent third party. GQ is the
                leading homeowner satisfaction company in our industry. They will ask you to rate us in key areas known
                to be important to homeowners. They then provide us with unbiased and unfiltered feedback so we know how
                well our clients think we are doing.
              </p>
              <p>
                This critical feedback allows us to improve our services and process when and where needed. This
                feedback and improvement cycle is one of the many ways that help us set ourselves apart from the
                competition.

            <summary>A Note About Our Process</summary>
            <div class="accordian-content">
              <p>To help assure our cost estimates are as accurate as possible, we use allowances based on the
                preferences and priorities we discussed in Step 2.</p>
              <p>In Step 4, unless you have made all of the needed product, material, and finish selections, the cost
                estimates we prepare will have “allowances” for the selections you will make later. As you can imagine,
                there is a wide range of costs among different types and qualities of products, materials, and finishes.
              </p>
              <p>Why do we do this? Knowing most people are conditioned to go with lower-priced proposals, some
                contractors use allowances that are below what will cover the cost of the products, materials and finish
                selections you are likely to pick. In this way, those contractors hope to get homeowners to sign on the
                dotted line. But when those homeowners start making selections, their actual project costs can
                skyrocket.</p>
